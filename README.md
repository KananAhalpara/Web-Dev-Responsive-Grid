Build a Webpage using a Responsive 12-Column Grid System
 

Please Note: This is not a design based assignment. The supplied files contain all the CSS and most of the HTML you'll need. You will not need to adjust the CSS at all, only the HTML should be modified! Modified CSS will result in loss of marks.

 

Starter Files: mtm1519-responsive-grid-starter.zip

Part 1: Flesh out the 12-column demo
Using the principles discussed in class, add the required classes to the column blocks to make them work responsively and appear the same way the output does. (the image is in the starter files, but you can also see the output here.)

Part 2: Build two equal columns
Using the template you've finished it part one, add a row in the section below the comments and build two columns equalling ~50% each.

Part 2: Build three equal columns
Using the template you've finished it part one, add a row in the section below the comments and build three columns equalling ~33% each.

Part 2: Build four equal columns
Using the template you've finished it part one, add a row in the section below the comments and build four columns equalling ~25% each.

Note about browsers and how they interpret decimals differently:
This isn’t a “perfect” grid in all browsers because of the way they interpret numbers with lots of decimals. Some only see the first decimal point and they don’t even bother rounding anything after. Safari, in particular, will make your columns a fraction of a percent off, and this can cause some visual misalignments. Be careful using this system if you know if must line up to the exact pixel (good luck coding it using pixels, it’s quite a feat!)
